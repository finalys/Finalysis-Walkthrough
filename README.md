# Finalysis Walkthrough

## Introduction & History
Hi, I'm Finalys. You may know me as the author of Finalysis which started in 2020 as a personal project to learn about python. [The very first Finalysis](https://twitter.com/_finalys_/status/1241254832989593606?s=20&t=voDlHTU61L76QXQsW92XNQ)
Finalysis started off as a project to summarize and derive insights from Shadowverse tournaments (mainly SVO and JCG). Now that I've sort of achieved what I wanted to learn, it is time to share my knowledge as I try to understand how GitHub works (previously I've been doing everything on Jupyter). I hope to work with others in the future on GitHub :)

The purpose is to share my process of how I process data from Shadowverse Tournaments, which should be suitable for beginners like me. I am pretty sure there are better/efficient ways to perform such tasks; I'm not from a STEM background so results is what matters to me more. 

As this is my very first public repo, I will try my best to pick up good habit and make it very digestable for fellow beginners. I hope to inspire more people to take the very first step, ideally in something that interest you like how Shadowverse did to me. (partly because I was pretty salty at losing in tournaments back then)

Again, I reiterate that I still consider myself a beginner so if there are any improvements/suggestions please feel free to let me know! Contact me via Discord: Finalys#7064
